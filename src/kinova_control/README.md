## Repo for Kinova Control in ROS1

For the board demo, please print the pattern [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dv87ul7B5-2UWBY4lAQ_gKVj2RhIlJhq/view). The aruco marker detection relies on the length of the printed marker. Printing the pattern with 100% scale is OK. The origin is at the corner in the image.
