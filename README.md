This repo houses the core code for Next Best Sense, the first work that autonomously and intelligently creates a scene for robot manipulators in Gaussian Splatting! Avoid the manually selecting poses, and let the robot do it for you in few views.

## Quick Start and Setup

We exclusively use Docker for this work, which allows for self-contained code. The pipeline has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and requires a GPU (3080+ 16+ GB VRAM). To avoid installation pains and dependency conflicts, we have a publicly available Dockerfile that includes everything [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/peasant98/active-touch-gs).

To pull from Docker, run the following:

```sh
docker pull peasant98/active-touch-gs:latest
```

To mount our code _within_ the Docker container, clone it as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/armlabstanford/NextBestSense

# clone fisherrf integrated into nerfstudio
git clone https://github.com/JiangWenPL/FisherRF-ns
cd FisherRF-ns/ && git clone https://github.com/JiangWenPL/modified-diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth

# run docker in privileged mode, interactive, expose the nerfstudio port, allow for graphics, and use all gpus! Recommended to put this in an alias
docker run --privileged -it --rm -p 7007:7007         --name nbs         --hostname nbs         --volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \\
-v `pwd`/FisherRF-ns:/home/user/FisherRF-ns -v `pwd`/NextBestSense:/home/user/NextBestSense         --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \\
--device=/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0         --env="DISPLAY=$DISPLAY"         -e "TERM=xterm-256color"         --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse \\
 --gpus all -it         peasant98/active-touch-gs:latest         bash
```

To install the local versions of the Nerfstudio packages:

```
cd FisherRF-ns/modified-diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth/ && pip install -e . -v
cd .. && pip install -e .

cd .. && cd NextBestSense/ && catkin build
source devel/setup.bash

# done!!
```




### Requirements (Not Using Docker):

- CUDA 11+ and a GPU with at least 16GB VRAM
- Python 3.8+
- ROS1 Noetic
- Conda or Mamba (optional)
- [Kinova Gen3 robot](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen3-robots#ProductSpecs) (7 DoF)

### Dependencies (from Nerfstudio)

Install PyTorch with CUDA (this repo has been tested with CUDA 11.8 and CUDA 12.1).

For CUDA 11.8:

```bash
conda create --name touch-gs python=3.8
conda activate touch-gs

pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda-toolkit
```

See [Dependencies](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/blob/main/docs/quickstart/installation.md#dependencies)
in the Installation documentation for more.


**Repo Cloning**
This repository should be used as a group of packages for a ROS1 workspace for controlling a Kinova arm.


## Install Our Version of Nerfstudio

We note that we have our own version of Nerfstudio, which supports active learning, which can be found [here](https://github.com/JiangWenPL/FisherRF-ns).

To install, the steps are:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/JiangWenPL/FisherRF-ns
cd FisherRF-ns

# install the package in editable mode for easy 
python3 -m pip install -e . -v
```



## Getting Next Best Sense Setup and Training

First, build the workspace (locally or within the Docker container):

```sh
# be outside the NextBestSense dir (ROS workspace)
catkin build
source install/setup.bash
```

Then, run the launch file, which will open the controller and vision node. Assuming you have our version of Nerfstudio installed, this will work as follows:

1. Run Kinova pipeline.


```sh
roslaunch kinova_control moveit_controller.launch
```

We have made an end-to-end pipeline that will take care of setting up the data, training, and evaluating our method. Note that we will release the code for running the ablations (which includes the baselines) soon!




## Get Rendered Video

You can get rendered videos with a custom camera path detailed [here](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/first_nerf.html#render-video). This is how we were able to get our videos on our website.
